# CodeVersioningWorkshopHomework

In the git data training workshop, ive learned the fundamental command lines such as git init, git add, git commit, git merge, git 
and git branch. Also, i learned how to handle merge conflicts in case of their occurence. From the git data training workshop, i also knew about IAC (Infrastructure as Code). From this workshop, ive learned the fundamental ways to operate with git.
